# Classification Of Pneumonia In Chest X-Rays
This computer vision project is designed to utilize Convultional Neural Networks to detect pneumonia based on chest X-rays.

# Motivating Facts
- Each year Pneumonia affects ~450 million people & is in the top 5 leading causes of death each year <sup>[1]<\sup>
- Over 2 Billion chest X-rays/yr are performed, over half of which lack access to radiological diagnostics [2]
- Chest X-rays are the best way to detect Pneumonia [3]

__Conclusion: Automated detection of pneumonia at the level of radiological experts would:__
- _Decrease_ the **time** it takes to get feedback on a medical diagnosis
- _Increase_ the **quantity** of patients diagnosed accurately
- _Increase_ the **quality** of care to patients

## Project Goals




## Conclusion



## Coronavirus Edition *GET INVOLVED!*
I am currently working with the company Arterys through UCLA's COVID-19 startup accelerator program to develop an open source tool that will identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus in chest X-rays & CT-Scans. This tool aims to streamline the diagnostics for overwhelmed and understaffed communities throughout the world.

*The diagnosis of COVID-19 through chest X-rays & CT-Scans has been performed in China, Italy, and the US [4]*
