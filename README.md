# Computer Vision Classification Of Pneumonia In Chest X-Rays
This project is designed to detect pneumonia based on chest X-rays.

# Motivating Facts
- Each year Pneumonia affects ~450 million people & is in the top 5 leading causes of death each year [1]
- Over 2 Billion chest X-rays/yr are performed, over half of which lack access to radiological diagnostics [2]
- Chest X-rays are the best way to detect Pneumonia [3]

__Conclusion: Automated detection of pneumonia at the level of radiological experts would:__
- _Decrease_ the **time** it takes to get feedback on a medical diagnosis
- _Increase_ the **quantity** of patients diagnosed accurately
- _Increase_ the **quality** of care to patients

## Project Goals




## Conclusion & Next Steps
I am currently working with the company Arterys through UCLA's COVID-19 startup accelerator program to develop an open source tool that will identify COVID-19 in chest X-rays to help streamline the diagnostics process for overwhelmed and understaffed communities throughout the world. Diagnostics precedent has been set by multiple countries including China, Italy, and the US as the main mode of diagnosis for COVID-19.
